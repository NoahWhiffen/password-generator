Good day, this is the app I created for my first assignment of Semester 3. It is a program that
will generate a random password for the user, given some parameters entered by the user.

Here are some instructions on how to use it:

Type --help to see a prompt with all possible commands. To run the program you must enter "node index.js" in the terminal followed by any
of the valid flags. The flags are:

--length (followed by how long you want the password to be. ie: 8)
--symbols
--uppercase
--numbers

The above flags will decide the length of your password, add symbols, add uppercase, and add numbers, respectievely. You can enter these flags in any order.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any password loss, or any security breaches due to use of any of these passwords. This was an assignment for school and not
actually intended to create "strong passwords" (whatever that entails).
